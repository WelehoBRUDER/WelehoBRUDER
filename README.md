## My skills

  - ``React``  
     I'm quite comfortable with React, but I'm still learning mechanics and best practices.
     
  - ``Javascript``  
     Javascript is my favourite programming language, and I will defend it to death.  
     I feel right at home when writing vanilla JS, and consider my self very competent.
     
  - ``SCSS``  
     Sass is the only way I can write CSS now, and yet I'm still at the beginning.
     
   - ``Typescript``  
     My largest ever project is being developed in Typescript, and so I am learning it quite well.
     
   - Notable mentions: ``Express.js``, ``Node.js``, ``mongoDB``
  
  
 ## My hobbies
 I enjoy programming and gaming during my freetime.  
 I also work out at the gym 4 times per week, and occasionally jog a bit outside.
